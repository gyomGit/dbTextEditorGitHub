# Db files Editor Eclipse Plug-in
============================

This whole repository contains these 8 projects that together build this Eclipse plug-in.
This plug-in is designed to edit db text files in Eclipse IDE, among other environments.

====

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.feature:
This project contains the description of the feature for this Db files Editor
implementation that can be found in the feature.xml file. Here, you can change
the name of the feature, the vendor, copyright information, and other things.
Eclipse has a form-based editor for features, and we refer to the Eclipse
documentation for the structure of this file.

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.ide:
This project contains the components related to the UI that are independent from
Eclipse (this is useful for targeting IntelliJ and web integration).

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.repository:
After a Maven build (mvn clean verify) the target folder of this project will
contain a zipped version of the update site and the subdirectory: "repository"
will contain the update site itself. (Before the build this project contains
only the category.xml and the pom.xml files.)

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.target:
This contains the target platform definition with all the dependencies to build
and test this Db files Editor.

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor:
This is the main project that contains the grammar definition, which is:
DbTextEditor.xtext and all the runtime components that are independent from the
UI. The grammar language is the corner stone of Xtext. It is a domain-specific
language, carefully designed for the description of our Db Syntax for instance.
It is the file to update if changes must be made such as adding a record or a
field name to the lists. To learn and understand this language: [Xtext grammar language documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/301_grammarlanguage.html).

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.tests:
This project contains the JUnit tests that do not depend on any UI.

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.ui.tests:
This project contains the JUnit tests that depend on the Eclipse UI.

### org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.ui:
This contains the components related to the Eclipse UI (the Eclipse editor and
features related to the Eclipse tooling).

## How to obtain Db files Editor Plug-in to be installed from dbTextEditorGitHub Github repository:

Click "Clone or download" and "Download Zip" the dbTextEditorGitHub-master.

## Build the plug-in with Maven:

There are two ways.

### Maven build from any operating system:

Install [Maven binaries](https://maven.apache.org/) in your operating system.

Run the build from the command line from the dbTextEditorGitHub-master
repository.

```bash
mvn clean verify
```
### Maven build from within Eclipse:

This way you do not need to install Maven on your computer.
Install [M2Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) abbreviated as m2e, a set of
Eclipse plug-ins that integrate Maven into Eclipse.
Right-click on the org.example.hellomaven.parent in the package explorer and
select Run As | Maven buildâ€¦ and in the appearing dialog specify "clean verify"
as the goals.
The goal clean will instruct Maven to perform a clean build, thus, all the
existing generated artifacts will be removed before building, for example, all
Java class files will be removed before compiling. The goal verify will instruct
Maven to compile everything, generate artifacts, for example jar files and
update sites, and run all the tests.


## How to install Db files Editor Plug-in in Eclipse:

After the Maven building is done:
the target folder of the org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.repository project
contains the update site and also a zipped version of it.

The subdirectory called "repository" which is the update site itself.
Just indicate the path of this "repository" update site in The Eclipse Install
New Software... dialog.

A zipped version of this update site, which is:
org.csstudio.xtext.dbtexteditor.repository-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip You can put the
zipped repository on the web as well to offer an offline installable version of
your software. The Eclipse Install New Software... dialog allows you to also
specify a local ZIP file as the repository.
